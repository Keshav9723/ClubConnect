# ClubConnect - Microservices Architecture

A comprehensive club management system built with Spring Boot microservices architecture, featuring service discovery, API gateway, and multiple specialized services for managing clubs, members, events, and registrations.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

ClubConnect follows a microservices architecture pattern with the following components:

- **Eureka Server** (Port 8761) - Service discovery and registration

- **Club Service** (Port 8081) - Manages club information and operations
- **Member Service** (Port 8082) - Handles member management
- **Event Service** (Port 8083) - Manages events and scheduling
- **Registration Service** (Port 8084) - Handles event registrations

  - `/clubs/**` ‚Üí Club Service
  - `/members/**` ‚Üí Member Service
  - `/events/**` ‚Üí Event Service
  - `/registrations/**` ‚Üí Registration Service

### 6. Eureka Server (Port 8761)
**Service Discovery and Registration**

- **Features**:
  - Service registry for all microservices
  - Health monitoring
  - Service discovery for API Gateway
  - Standalone mode configuration

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

Each service uses its own H2 in-memory database:

- **Club Service**: `clubdb` - Stores clubs, members, and events
- **Member Service**: `memberdb` - Member information with club associations
- **Event Service**: `eventdb` - Event details with capacity management
- **Registration Service**: `registrationdb` - Event registration records

### Sample Data

The system initializes with realistic sample data:

**Clubs**: Tech Club, Sports Club, Arts Club
**Members**: 5 sample members with different club affiliations
**Events**: 5 upcoming events across different clubs
**Registrations**: 5 sample registrations linking members to events

# Test service status
curl http://localhost:8081/
curl http://localhost:8082/
curl http://localhost:8083/
curl http://localhost:8084/

Each service provides H2 console access:
- Club Service: http://localhost:8081/h2-console
- Member Service: http://localhost:8082/h2-console
- Event Service: http://localhost:8083/h2-console
- Registration Service: http://localhost:8084/h2-console

**Default H2 Credentials**:
